# HitchHiker
Cadet Rideshare App

Overview: This application attempted to provide a platform for cadets to share rides to common locations by having drivers and riders interatct on a common platform

Architecture: We used Django for this project

Known Issues: This application has an issue with its ability to query the database and search for rides that include certain riders or drivers. There was also an issue in the deployment. Amazon Web Services provided me with a link to view my app but the link only shows a 404 error. Amazon does not provide any info on why this is happening. 

Recommended improvements: This application could have benefitted from a simpler database background. Also, the applicatoin deployment needs to be fixed but I don't know where the issue is in the code.

Our application is deployed on Amazon Web Services at http://hitch-env.r7vhjp9dpz.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/ with an Environment ID of e-nnd5hv5pkh
